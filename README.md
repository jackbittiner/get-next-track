# PlayThru

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jackbittiner/play-thru.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jackbittiner/play-thru)

This is a song recommendation app for DJs.

When you play a song on Spotify, this app will recommend songs with a similar BPM and also written in the same, or harmonic, keys.

It is currently a work in progress.

Play with it here: [PlayThru](https://play-thru.herokuapp.com/)

## What's left to come

Deploy the code to heroku. Currently just figuring out the best way to deploy a monorepo.

Finish the functionality of the app and improve the overall UX.

Then I think a lick of paint wouldn't go amiss.

Submit to spotify devloper showcase.
